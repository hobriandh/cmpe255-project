## Presentation

We presented the core principles of GANs to the class on March 9th. You can review our presentation at Andrew's GitHub. Since we were the first to present, we had no time to implement any of our ideas, thus this report presents details about our implementation strategies.

## Abstract

Our research focuses on *Generative Adversarial Networks* (GANs). We chose to divide the work so we could explore two unique applications of GANs. This way, we could compare and contrast the efficacy of different architectures and approaches. Andrew and Brian chose to focus on training a GAN to generate pictures from text; in other words, text-to-image. Chinmay and Pratik chose to focus on...

## Super Resolution (SR) GANs

### Approach

Super resolution GANs aims to increase the resolution of images.  SR GANs applies a deep neural network in combination with an adversary network to produce these images.  During the training, a high-resolution image is sampled along with a low-resolution counterpart.
